Information Visualization of Heart Disease Data using Python (exercise for university)

Heart disease is a major public health issue worldwide, and there is a wealth of data available on the topic. In this project, I will use a heart disease dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease) to create informative and visually appealing visualizations using Python. The goal is to provide insights into the prevalence and risk factors of heart disease, and to help users better understand the data and trends.
