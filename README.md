# InfoVis-Project
Information Visualization of Heart Disease Data using Python and Vega-Lite (exercise for university)

Heart disease is a major public health issue worldwide, and there is a wealth of data available on the topic. In this project, I will use a heart disease dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease) to create informative and visually appealing visualizations using Python and Vega-Lite. The goal is to provide insights into the prevalence and risk factors of heart disease, and to help users better understand the data and trends.
